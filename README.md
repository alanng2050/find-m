#### Given a cirlce with:

- R is radius of the circle
- A Center point (x, y) of the circle

#### You already have

- x coordinates
- and you want to find y coordinates to have a list of points (x, y) on the circle

=> So this function will help you to find the `y coordinates` or vice versa `x coordinates`
